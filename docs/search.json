    "text": "In this homework, I will use base R to complete some basic problems. These will showcase different ways of handling R without using fancy packages.\n\nTask 1: Basic Vector Practice\nWe will create two vectors that represent blood pressure pre and post treatment of a new medical intervention.\n\n# create the pre-test vector\npre = c(120, 151, 125, 126, 115, 132, 132, 129, 134, 139, 127, 122, 127, 135, 133, 128, 147, 138, 140, 132)\n\n# create the post-test vector\npost = c(127, 145, 135, 122, 115, 122, 123, 126, 126, 129, 132, 146, 120, 114, 121, 120, 128, 120, 133, 115)\n\n# create the names for our pre and post vectors\nnames = paste(\"Subject\", 1:20, sep = \"_\")\n\n# assign the names for our vectors\nnames(pre) = names\nnames(post) = names\n\nLet’s visually confirm that the names have been assigned as we want them.\n\nprint(pre)\n\n Subject_1  Subject_2  Subject_3  Subject_4  Subject_5  Subject_6  Subject_7 \n       120        151        125        126        115        132        132 \n Subject_8  Subject_9 Subject_10 Subject_11 Subject_12 Subject_13 Subject_14 \n       129        134        139        127        122        127        135 \nSubject_15 Subject_16 Subject_17 Subject_18 Subject_19 Subject_20 \n       133        128        147        138        140        132 \n\n\n\nprint(post)\n\n Subject_1  Subject_2  Subject_3  Subject_4  Subject_5  Subject_6  Subject_7 \n       127        145        135        122        115        122        123 \n Subject_8  Subject_9 Subject_10 Subject_11 Subject_12 Subject_13 Subject_14 \n       126        126        129        132        146        120        114 \nSubject_15 Subject_16 Subject_17 Subject_18 Subject_19 Subject_20 \n       121        120        128        120        133        115 \n\n\nThese look good! Now we can continue with the tasks and calculate the change in blood pressure.\n\nchange = pre - post\nchange # we can view these changes for each subject\n\n Subject_1  Subject_2  Subject_3  Subject_4  Subject_5  Subject_6  Subject_7 \n        -7          6        -10          4          0         10          9 \n Subject_8  Subject_9 Subject_10 Subject_11 Subject_12 Subject_13 Subject_14 \n         3          8         10         -5        -24          7         21 \nSubject_15 Subject_16 Subject_17 Subject_18 Subject_19 Subject_20 \n        12          8         19         18          7         17 \n\n\nNow, we calculate the average blood decrease by taking the mean of our change variable.\n\nmean(change)\n\n[1] 5.65\n\n\nWe see that on average, the blood pressure difference was 5.65, indicating that the blood pressure dropped on average. Next, let’s see which patients saw a decrease in blood pressure. Note that decreases in blood pressure show up as positive values here.\n\nwhich(change &gt; 0) # grab all subjects with positive change value\n\n Subject_2  Subject_4  Subject_6  Subject_7  Subject_8  Subject_9 Subject_10 \n         2          4          6          7          8          9         10 \nSubject_13 Subject_14 Subject_15 Subject_16 Subject_17 Subject_18 Subject_19 \n        13         14         15         16         17         18         19 \nSubject_20 \n        20 \n\n\nNext, we will subset the change vector so we only see those patients who saw a decrease in blood pressure. We’ll do this with a Boolean.\n\npositive_change = change[change &gt; 0] # grab the patients who have a positive change in blood pressure\npositive_change # we love to see positive changes!\n\n Subject_2  Subject_4  Subject_6  Subject_7  Subject_8  Subject_9 Subject_10 \n         6          4         10          9          3          8         10 \nSubject_13 Subject_14 Subject_15 Subject_16 Subject_17 Subject_18 Subject_19 \n         7         21         12          8         19         18          7 \nSubject_20 \n        17 \n\n\nFinally, let’s grab the average decrease in blood pressure for this subpopulation.\n\nmean(positive_change)\n\n[1] 10.6\n\n\nThis is larger than we saw earlier, which makes sense since we dropped the patients with negative values!\n\n\nTask 2: Data Frame Basics\nLet’s start by making a data frame of the patient, pre, post, and change vectors we made in Task 1.\n\ndf = data.frame(names, pre, post, change)\ndf # let's see it so we can visualize what we \n\n                names pre post change\nSubject_1   Subject_1 120  127     -7\nSubject_2   Subject_2 151  145      6\nSubject_3   Subject_3 125  135    -10\nSubject_4   Subject_4 126  122      4\nSubject_5   Subject_5 115  115      0\nSubject_6   Subject_6 132  122     10\nSubject_7   Subject_7 132  123      9\nSubject_8   Subject_8 129  126      3\nSubject_9   Subject_9 134  126      8\nSubject_10 Subject_10 139  129     10\nSubject_11 Subject_11 127  132     -5\nSubject_12 Subject_12 122  146    -24\nSubject_13 Subject_13 127  120      7\nSubject_14 Subject_14 135  114     21\nSubject_15 Subject_15 133  121     12\nSubject_16 Subject_16 128  120      8\nSubject_17 Subject_17 147  128     19\nSubject_18 Subject_18 138  120     18\nSubject_19 Subject_19 140  133      7\nSubject_20 Subject_20 132  115     17\n\n\nNow lets return only rows where the change in bp is negative.\n\nsubset(df,df$change &lt;

120 and FALSE otherwise.\n\nlow = post &lt; 120 # we can assign the Boolean with this\ndf$low_bp = low # add to the df\n\nknitr::kable(df) # now we print it out nice!\n\n\n\n\n\nnames\npre\npost\nchange\nlow_bp\n\n\n\n\nSubject_1\nSubject_1\n120\n127\n-7\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_2\nSubject_2\n151\n145\n6\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_3\nSubject_3\n125\n135\n-10\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_4\nSubject_4\n126\n122\n4\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_5\nSubject_5\n115\n115\n0\nTRUE\n\n\nSubject_6\nSubject_6\n132\n122\n10\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_7\nSubject_7\n132\n123\n9\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_8\nSubject_8\n129\n126\n3\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_9\nSubject_9\n134\n126\n8\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_10\nSubject_10\n139\n129\n10\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_11\nSubject_11\n127\n132\n-5\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_12\nSubject_12\n122\n146\n-24\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_13\nSubject_13\n127\n120\n7\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_14\nSubject_14\n135\n114\n21\nTRUE\n\n\nSubject_15\nSubject_15\n133\n121\n12\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_16\nSubject_16\n128\n120\n8\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_17\nSubject_17\n147\n128\n19\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_18\nSubject_18\n138\n120\n18\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_19\nSubject_19\n140\n133\n7\nFALSE\n\n\nSubject_20\nSubject_20\n132\n115\n17\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Lists and Lists\nWe now will add in the placebo group to the equation!\n\n# first make the pre and post as vectors\npre2 = c(138, 135, 147, 117, 152, 134, 114, 121, 131, 130)\npost2 = c(105, 136, 123, 130, 134, 143, 135, 139, 120, 124)\n\n# create the names for our pre and post vectors\nnames2 = paste(\"Subject\", 1:10, sep = \"_\")\n\n# assign the names for our vectors\nnames(pre2) = names2\nnames(post2) = names2\n\n# calculate the difference for the placebo group\nchange2 = pre2 - post2\n\n# now create a data frame like the first one\ndf2 = data.frame(names2, pre2, post2, change2)\n\n# add the TRUE/FALSE column for low bp scores\nlow2 = post2 &lt;
